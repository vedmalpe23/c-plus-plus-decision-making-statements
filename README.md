# C++ Decision Making and Control Statements

## Aim
To study and implement C++ decision-making and control statements through different types of conditional and control structures.

---

## Theory Overview

C++ supports various control and decision-making statements that allow the flow of a program to change based on certain conditions. These are crucial for implementing logic and decision structures.

## C++ Decision-Making Statements

| Sr.No | Statement              | Description |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1     | `if` Statement         | Evaluates a boolean expression and executes code if the condition is true. |
| 2     | `if...else` Statement  | Provides an alternate path when the `if` condition is false. |
| 3     | `switch` Statement     | Tests a variable against multiple values for equality. |
| 4     | Nested `if` Statements | Using `if` or `else if` inside another `if` or `else if`. |
| 5     | Nested `switch` Statements | A `switch` inside another `switch`. |

## C++ Control Statements

Control statements in C++ are categorized as follows:

### 1. **Selection Statements**
- `if...else`
- `switch...case`

### 2. **Iteration Statements**
- `while`
- `do...while`
- `for`

### 3. **Jump Statements**
- `break`
- `continue`
- `goto`

## **Conclusion**

C++ decision-making and control statements are essential for directing program flow based on conditions and iterations. Mastering constructs like if, else, switch, and loops enables developers to build logical, dynamic, and efficient programs. These statements form the backbone of real-world problem-solving in C++.
